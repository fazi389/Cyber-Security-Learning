# 📘 Networking Fundamentals – Weekly Learning Notes

## 🖥️ Hardware & Software
- **Data Transmission Modes**: Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex
- **Devices**: Hub, Bridge, Switch, Router

## 🧠 OSI Model (7 Layers)
- Mnemonic: *All People Seem To Need Data Processing*
1. Application
2. Presentation
3. Session
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Data Link
7. Physical

## 🌐 TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
- Mnemonic: *NITA*
1. Network Interface
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

## 🔗 Network Basics
- **Topologies**: Mesh, Bus, Star
- **Types of Networks**: LAN, MAN, WAN

## 🧾 Addresses
- **MAC Address**: Physical address of a device
- **IP Address**: Logical address (Public, Private, Loopback, Classes A-E)

## 📦 IP Header Fields
- Version, IHL, TOS, Total Length, Identifier, Flags, Fragment Offset
- TTL, Protocol, Header Checksum, Source IP, Destination IP, Options

## 🔧 Subnetting
- Divides network into smaller networks
- Based on Hosts or Network requirement
- VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

## 🔧 Supernetting
- Combines small networks into a large network
- Binary conversion of network IDs → match bits → identify network portion

## 🌍 DNS – Domain Name System
- Name resolution: Flat & Hierarchical Name Space
- Components:
  - Root Servers (A–M)
  - Top Level Domain (.com, .org, .pk)
  - Authoritative Name Servers (e.g., www.facebook.com)
- Modes: Recursive, Iterative

## 🔁 NAT – Network Address Translation
- Converts multiple private IPs to a single public IP

## 📡 DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- **Client-Server Model** using DORA Process:
  1. Discover
  2. Offer
  3. Request
  4. Acknowledge
- Ports:
  - 67 (Server)
  - 68 (Client)
- DHCP Scope, Super Scope
- Defined in RFC 2131

## 📤 SMTP – Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- Sends email (Port 25)
- Other email protocols: POP3, IMAP

## 🔍 ARP – Address Resolution Protocol
- Resolves IP to MAC address (IPv4 only)
- Works within same network
- Maintains CAM table (IP-MAC mapping)

## 🔄 TCP vs UDP
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented (used for important data)
- **UDP**: Fast, connectionless (used for streaming, VoIP)

## 🌀 Ports
- Software-based, managed by OS
- **Port Ranges**:
  - Well-known: 0–1023 (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP)
  - Registered: 1024–49151 (MySQL, RDP)
  - Dynamic: 49152–65535 (Temporary)

### Common Ports
| Service | Port |
|--------|------|
| HTTP   | 80   |
| HTTPS  | 443  |
| FTP    | 21   |
| SSH    | 22   |
| DNS    | 53   |
| SMTP   | 25   |
| POP3   | 110  |
| RDP    | 3389 |

## 🧩 Socket
- Combination of:
  - Source IP + Destination IP + Source Port + Destination Port

## 🔗 URI Types
- URL, URN → HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SSH

## 🛠️ Common Network Services
- DNS, SSH, SMTP, POP, IMAP, DHCP, FTP

## 📟 Telnet vs SSH
- Remote Access Tools
- Telnet (Insecure), SSH (Secure)
- Example Commands:
  - `telnet 192.168.2.3`
  - `ssh -l admin 192.168.2.2`

## 🧪 Network Troubleshooting Commands
- `ipconfig` – View IP Configuration
- `ping` – Check connectivity
- `netstat` – Show active connections
- `tracert` – Trace route to destination
- `nslookup` – DNS query tool

## 💻 CMD Commands
- `ipconfig /all` – Detailed IP info
- `ipconfig /renew` – Request new IP
- `netstat` – Active ports
- `arp -a` – ARP table view
- `arp -d` – ARP table clear
- `nslookup www.google.com` – DNS query
- `ftp 209.23.3.4` – Connect to FTP server

## 📁 Cisco Packet Tracer File Types
| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| .pkt      | Simulated network (no instructions) |
| .pka      | Activity file with steps and instructions |
| .pksz     | Bundle of `.pka` files with hints |
| .pkz      | Project or compressed bundle |
