📘 Networking Devices & Initial Configuration – Learning Summary
✅ Completed from Cisco Networking Academy
📅 (Month-Year, e.g. July 2025)
🎓 Focus: Foundational concepts of networking, device configuration, subnetting, protocols, and troubleshooting using Cisco IOS.

📌 Key Concepts Learned
🏗️ Hierarchical Network Design
Explained the core, distribution, and access layers of network architecture

Understood scalability, performance, and redundancy benefits

☁️ Virtualization & Cloud Services
Compared physical vs. virtual devices (routers, switches, firewalls)

Described the role of cloud infrastructure in modern networks

🔌 Ethernet & Switching
Understood Ethernet operation at Layer 2

Learned about MAC address tables and frame forwarding

🌐 Network Layer & IP Routing
Configured basic routing to enable end-to-end IP connectivity

Learned how routers make forwarding decisions using routing tables

✂️ IPv4 Subnetting
Subnetted networks efficiently using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

Calculated usable hosts and address ranges

🔁 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Understood ARP role in mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses

Observed ARP request/reply process in LANs

🗂️ DNS & DHCP
Explained dynamic IP assignment via DHCP

Analyzed how DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses

🧱 Transport Layer Protocols
Compared TCP vs. UDP for reliability, flow control, and speed

Identified port numbers and sessions

🧰 Practical Skills Gained
Used Cisco IOS CLI for configuring switches and routers

Built simple networks in Cisco Packet Tracer

Verified connectivity with ping, traceroute, and show commands

Configured static IPs, DHCP clients, and default gateways

Performed basic troubleshooting of Layer 1 to Layer 3 issues

💡 Tools & Platforms
